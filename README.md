# "Phrase Hunter" Game Show App
 My fourth Treehouse Techdegree project: A game in which a player tries to guess letters in a hidden phrase. If they guess incorrectly five times, they've lost the game, but if they guess the phrase with five or less misses, they win. 
 
 I am going for an exceeds expectations grade, so my game includes some custom styles and works with keyboard key presses (not just clicks on the game keyboard). My custom styles are: 
 - Changing the start game button to say "Play Again?" after the first game
 - Setting the lose overlay to a soft pink and the win overlay to a softer green
 - Setting the correct button/key background color to match the phrase letter background color
 - Setting the wrong button/key background color to dark gray
 - Giving the h1 HTML tag a 30px margin
