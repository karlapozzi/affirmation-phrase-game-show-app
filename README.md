# "Phrase Hunter" Game Show App
 My fourth Treehouse Techdegree project: A game in which a player tries to guess letters in a hidden phrase. If they guess incorrectly five times, they've lost the game, but if they guess the phrase with five or less misses, they win. 
 
 I am going for an exceeds expecations grade, so my project includes keyboard functionality as well as some custom styles.
